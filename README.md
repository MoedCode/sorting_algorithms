# Sorting Algorithms & Big O Notation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing sorting algorithms, understanding Big O notation, and demonstrating proficiency in sorting algorithm concepts in C programming. The project requires implementing sorting algorithms, evaluating their time complexity, selecting the most suitable algorithm for a given input, and understanding stable sorting algorithms.

## Requirements

- The project is designed to be completed by pairs of two students who should pair program for at least the mandatory part.
- You are required to implement at least four different sorting algorithms from scratch.
- Understand and explain the concept of Big O notation, and evaluate the time complexity of algorithms.
- Choose the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
- Implement a stable sorting algorithm that preserves the relative order of equal elements.
- The project should adhere to coding standards, use provided header files and functions for printing arrays and linked lists, and avoid global variables.

## Project Structure

- The project consists of C source files, a header file (`sort.h`), and main files for testing.
- The `print_array` and `print_list` functions are provided for printing arrays and linked lists, respectively.
- A doubly linked list structure is used to store data.

## Compilation and Testing

To compile the project, use the provided compilation command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c print_array.c sort.c -o sort
```
